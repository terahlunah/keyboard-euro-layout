# Euro Keyboard Layout for Windows

This layout is based on the **US International Layout**, with added diacritics and other special characters accessible via `<Alt Gr>` and **no dead keys**.

---

Contrary to the standard **US International Layout**, which has a few dead keys (apostrophe `'`, double quotes `"`, circumflex `^`, backtick `` ` `` and tilde `~`) to enable typing chraracters such as `éäñ`, the **Euro Layout** uses `<Alt Gr>` to directly access these characters and has **no dead keys**.
This is particularly useful for programmers who often need direct access to the charaters behind dead keys.

**Covered languages** :

- Albanian
- Catalan
- Danish
- Dutch
- English
- **Esperanto**
- French
- German
- Irish
- Italian
- Norwegian
- Portuguese
- Spanish
- Swedish

In this **Euro Layout**, the diacritics positions have been optimised for Esperanto, French and German

Feel free to clone this repo and adapt it for your languages!
